I wanted to share with you how to make your R / data science world coexist with Windows.\n\n# Don't Use Windows Alone\n\nHonestly, the biggest tip is not to attempt to use naked Windows as your R development platform. You want to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or a full Linux Virtual Machine. Among the major reasons for this is consistently good package installation behavior. My experience is that R packages don't install reliably in Windows. Some will, some won't and why bother fighting it? Just use WSL or a virtual machine with Ubuntu.\n\nIf you haven't tried it, you may be surprised at how full-featured WSL is. In addition to acting like Ubuntu, WSL 2 now does a really good job of supporting GUI based applications thanks to WSLg. I strongly suggest you use it as your default development location.\n\nOne other big advantage of WSL is that because it's a user space process you don't need admin rights to your laptop. So long as you get WSL version 2 you are pretty much set. The lack of admin rights makes security people very happy. There are some minor annoyances to walk through before everything works and we'll go over them. Except for the desktop experience (long live Xfce!) you will find WSL a very cozy place to live. Of course, WSL is also a very happy place for Python development, so extending WSL to support RStudio seems like a natural fit. WSL is also a much lower maintenance environment than running Docker for Windows just to do R development.\n\n## RStudio Server?\n\nAnother possibility, outside the scope of this document, is to use RStudio Server. This is especially useful if your user base tends to have seriously underpowered laptops. In addition to giving you full Linux/Rstudio goodness you also have a single place to manage package dependencies. Your team gains velocity because you aren't all trying to figure out which Linux packages must be present to compile a specific R package. This can also be a huge help in managing connectivity to corporate data sources. Fixing access issues in one place may be much easier than fixing it in every developer's laptop. Imagine having to set up R with ODBC on half a dozen laptops and you'll see where this wins.\n\nFor the rest of this article we assume you will go down the WSL path, but some tips may still apply to you elsewhere, like using the Posit repo and `here()`.\n\n# WSL Configuration\n\nMake sure you have the correct WSL version. You'll want to have version 2, which *is* also available for Windows 10. In PowerShell:\n\n``` text\nPS C:\\WINDOWS\\system32> wsl -l -v\n  NAME      STATE           VERSION\n* Ubuntu    Running         2\nPS C:\\WINDOWS\\system32>\n```\n\nIf you are not on version 2 you'll need admin rights to run an elevated PowerShell and then:\n\n``` text\nPS C:\\WINDOWS\\system32> wsl --update\n```\n\nTo complete your R/WSL installation you'll need to restart WSL a few times. For that you'll use:\n\n``` bash\nPS C:\\WINDOWS\\system32> wsl --shutdown\n```\n\nIf you are already at version 2 you should be able to install basic editors and any package really that isn't network dependent. For instance:\n\n``` bash\n$ sudo apt install gedit\n```\n\nGo ahead and install your favorite editor now and replace `gedit` with it whenever you see it. Another benefit of WSL 2 is you can install Ubuntu 24, which would not install on WSL 1.\n\n# Git\n\nIn addition to git there is now a gh (github) CLI which has a number of useful features to make your interactions with github easier, but I especially like the auth command.\n\n``` bash\n$ curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg\necho \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null\n$ sudo apt update\n$ sudo apt install git gh\n\n# Make sure you already have a Github login.\n# Add --hostname your_gh_server.your_corp.com if using a private repo\n$ gh auth login \n\n$ git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n$ git config --global user.email \"your.email@example.com\"\n```\n\n# VS Code\n\nReally can't stress enough how much I hate VS Code. Mostly because my use of it is intermittent and this is one of those bro tools that wants you to show your machismo by absolutely not making anything intuitive. Still, I do use it, especially with SQL Tools extensions to help me view and edit my source databases.\n\n**Do NOT install VS Code in WSL.** I believe in previous versions of WSL and VS Code there were shims to install but as of WSL 2 and late 2025 none of this is needed now. Install VS Code from the Microsoft Store like any other Windows application. The trick is to launch VS Code from inside WSL.\n\nThere is one minor fixup in WSL you should do. Set up the git commit message editor to use `code` as well:\n\n``` bash\n$ git config --global core.editor \"code --wait\"\n$ cd ~/dev\n$ code . # Launches the Windows VS Code but sees ~/dev file folders.\n```\n\nWhen it finishes launching look on the bottom left corner of the window and you should see this:\n\n![WSL Connected](images/wsl_connected.jpg)\n\nIf you do then you are all set. VS Code will work as if it was natively running in your WSL / Ubuntu OS. Your VS add-ons, virtual environment settings, and direnv will all behave exactly as you would expect so long as you start code in the right directory.\n\n# AppArmor\n\nWSL is meant to look and feel like a terminal only version of real Ubuntu and for the most part it offers you just that. The one place where the illusion breaks is with apparmor. Normally you don't care until an installer breaks because apparmor really isn't there. This applies to most packages which work over the network. One example of a tool that breaks in installation is the Postgres admin tool, pgadmin-desktop.\n\nIt's worth just getting this out of the way once so you never have to deal with it again.\n\n## Configure systemd\n\n``` bash\n$ sudo gedit /etc/wsl.conf\n```\n\nAdd the following two lines:\n\n``` text\n[boot] \nsystemd=true\n```\n\nNote that this may make the following warning appear each time you start WSL. It is safe to ignore:\n\n``` text\nwsl: Failed to start the systemd user session for 'yourname'. See journalctl for more details.\n```\n\n## Edit fstab\n\nAdd the following line to the end of /etc/fstab:\n\n``` text\nsecurityfs /sys/kernel/security securityfs defaults 0 0\n```\n\n## Restart\n\n``` text\n# In powershell:\nwsl --shutdown\n```\n\nStart your WSL normally.\n\n## Enable AppArmor\n\n``` bash\nsudo systemctl enable --now apparmor\n```\n\nReboot WSL once more and try an experiment:\n\n``` bash\n$ sudo apt install pgadmin-desktop\n```\n\nIf this installs without throwing an error you are good to go.\n\n# R\n\n## Install R itself:\n\n``` bash\n$ sudo apt install build-essential gfortran\n$ sudo apt install r-base\n$ sudo apt install libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype6-dev\n```\n\n## Configure your R Package Source\n\nBefore installing user libraries set up your .Rprofile to use the Posit repo. The main reason is this repo has pre-compiled R packages so is much faster than CRAN. Duckdb for instance can take an hour or more to install from CRAN.\n\nFind your Ubuntu codename:\n\n``` text\n$ lsb_release -a\n\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS\nRelease:        24.04\nCodename:       noble\n```\n\nFrom WSL: `$ gedit ~/.Rprofile` Add these lines to Rprofile. Replace \"noble\" with the codename from above then edit the file:\n\n``` {.r eval=\"FALSE\"}\noptions(repos = c(CRAN = \"https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/__linux__/noble/latest\"))\n\n.libPaths(c(\"~/R/library\", .libPaths()))\n\n# Set Cairo as default bitmap device\n# This is only needed for OSX, but here just in case plots don't render.\n# options(bitmapType = \"cairo\")\n```\n\n## Install RStudio:\n\nGo to [Posit's download page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and scroll down to find the right deb package (from lsb_release, above), and paste the link to it below:\n\n``` bash\n$ mkdir ~/downloads\n$ cd ~/downloads\n\n$ wget https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/jammy/amd64/rstudio-2025.09.2-418-amd64.deb\n\n$ sudo apt install ./rstudio-2025.09.2-418-amd64.deb\n```\n\nStart RStudio and check that you have the Posit repo installed:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n> getOption(\"repos\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nShould return a string with \"posit\".\n\n**Protip:** if you have significant trouble installing R packages from Posit or CRAN try installing the Ubuntu package first, and then re-installing your user library version. This will help because the repo builders do an excellent job of installing all the OS package dependencies. You can then install the package to your local library. For instance:\n\n``` bash\n$ sudo apt install r-cran-tidyverse\n```\n\nThen in RStudio:\n\n``` r\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n\nThis way you'll get the latest version from CRAN or Posit.\n\n## R Libraries\n\nIf you work among others who are forced to do R in Windows I strongly suggest you leverage the here package/function. It is like `this.path` but with automatic path separators based on the OS you are using.\n\nhere() returns the path relative to the project, so it allows for portability not just among Windows/Linux but also from R scripts and Rmd/Qmd docs and Shiny apps.\n\n``` r\nlibrary(here)\ndf <- read_rds(here('data', 'my_datastore.rds'))\n```\n\nWhen running from Rscript though you need to start in the project root. Here's an example:\n\n``` text\n$ cd ~/dev/finance_forecast_project\n$ Rscript R/my_forecast.R\n```\n\n# Homebrew\n\nHomebrew is a great tool for OSX developers. I'm pretty sure every single development tool and package out there has a recipe or cask for OSX. It's being developed for Linux as well but support is pretty spotty and honestly just IMHO not necessary. 'apt install' works just fine.\n\n# Perl\n\nIf you are going to do Perl development you should install [perlbrew](https://perlbrew.pl/). This gives you a personal Perl installation you can pick and chose the effective Perl version. Install the padwalker package from CPAN and you should be able to debug in VS Code like you would any other remote Perl installation.\n",
