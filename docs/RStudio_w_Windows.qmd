# Introduction

I've usually used RStudio on OSX or Linux but recent job changes have forced me to live inside a Windows 10/11 laptop. I wanted to share with you how to make your R / data science world coexist with Windows.

# Naked Windows Installation

If you absolutely must run Windows without WSL or a Linux virtual machine you should consider [changing your repo to install from prebuilt binaries](#install-r-packages-from-binaries). This will usually prevent you from having to compile anything and is much faster than installing from sources.  There are R/RStudio users who end up happy this way, I was not one of them. 

If your main development tool is R and RStudio and all the packages you need are available as binaries you may be all set and the rest of this doc may not be useful to you. 

# Don't Use Windows Alone

My biggest tip if you are struggling or need to use other tools is to avoid using naked Windows as your R development platform. The more reliable and more pain-free path IMHO is to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or a full Linux Virtual Machine. Among the major reasons for this is consistently reliable package installation behavior. My experience is that:

- R package installation on Windows is less predictable than on Linux, especially once compilation or system dependencies are involved. 
- Additional developer tools will be Linux first, Windows as an afterthought. 
- Outside of R, you will constantly fight path and script translation issues.

If you haven't tried it, you may be surprised at how full-featured WSL is. In addition to acting like Ubuntu, WSL 2 now does a really good job of supporting GUI based applications thanks to WSLg. I strongly suggest you use it as your default development location.

One other big advantage of WSL is that because it's a user space process you don't need admin rights to your laptop. So long as you get WSL version 2 you are pretty much set. The lack of admin rights makes security people very happy. There are some minor annoyances to walk through before everything works and we'll go over them. Except for the desktop experience (long live Xfce!) you will find WSL a very cozy place to live. Of course, WSL is also a very happy place for Python development, so extending WSL to support RStudio seems like a natural fit. WSL is also a much lower maintenance environment than running Docker for Windows just to do R development.

Think of the rest of this document as a guide to configure an R-centric, but not R-exclusive, development environment on Windows.   


## RStudio Server?

Another possibility, outside the scope of this document, is to use RStudio Server. This is especially useful if your user base tends to have seriously underpowered laptops. In addition to giving you full Linux/RStudio goodness you also have a single place to manage package dependencies. Your team gains velocity because you aren't all trying to figure out which Linux packages must be present to compile a specific R package. This can also be a huge help in managing connectivity to corporate data sources. Fixing access issues in one place may be much easier than fixing it in every developer's laptop. Imagine having to set up R with ODBC on half a dozen laptops and you'll see where this wins.

For the rest of this article we assume you will go down the WSL path, but some tips may still apply to you elsewhere, like using the Posit repo and `here()`.

# Windows Subsystem for Linux

## Installation

If you don't even have WSL installed you will need to install it. You can install from an elevated PowerShell:

``` text
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> wsl --install
```

## Configuration

Make sure you have the correct WSL version. You'll want to have version 2, which *is* also available for Windows 10. In PowerShell:

``` text
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> wsl -l -v

  NAME      STATE           VERSION
* Ubuntu    Running         2
```

If you are not on version 2 you'll need admin rights to run an elevated PowerShell and then:

``` text
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> wsl --update
```

To complete your WSL installation you'll need to restart WSL a few times. For that you'll use:

``` text
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> wsl --shutdown
```

If you are already at version 2 you should be able to install basic editors and any package really that isn't network dependent. For instance:

``` bash
$ sudo apt install gedit
```

Go ahead and install your favorite editor now and replace `gedit` with it whenever you see it. Another benefit of WSL 2 is you can install Ubuntu 24, which would not install on WSL 1.

# Git

In addition to git there is now a gh (github) CLI which has a number of useful features to make your interactions with github easier, but I especially like the auth command.

``` bash
# Install gh
$ curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install git gh

# Authenticate your git installation.
# Make sure you already have a Github login.
# Add --hostname your_gh_server.your_corp.com if using a private repo
$ gh auth login 

# Despite gh doing the auth for you we still need a couple more configs
# to make commits automatic. 
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

# VS Code

Really can't stress enough how much I hate VS Code. Despite my personal feelings, I cannot deny that I still am forced to use VS Code so it must co-exist with my other tools.

Installing VS Code with WSL may be confusingly simple for some because previous versions of WSL and VS Code required more complicated setups and shims. That's no longer true. Here's the rule:

**Do NOT install VS Code in WSL.**

We now install VS Code from the Microsoft Store like any other Windows application. The trick to happiness is that we will *install* VS Code in Windows but we will *launch* VS Code from inside WSL.

You can install VS Code from the Microsoft Store UI or even simply from PowerShell like this:

``` text
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode
```

There is one minor fixup in WSL for git you should do now, before starting code. Set up the git commit message editor to use `code` as well:

``` bash
$ git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
$ cd ~/dev
```

OK, now you are ready to experience the magic of VS Code / WSL integration!

``` bash
# If needed: 
# mkdir ~/dev 
$ cd ~/dev
$ code . # Launches the Windows VS Code but sees ~/dev file folders.
```

When it finishes launching look on the bottom left corner of the window and you should see this:

![WSL Connected](images/wsl_connected.jpg)

If you do then you are all set. VS Code will work as if it was natively running in your WSL / Ubuntu OS. Your VS extentions, virtual environment settings, and direnv will all behave exactly as you would expect so long as you start code in the right directory. This of course also means that if VS Code is your IDE of choice you are free to use it for R as well.

VS Code will remember your connection preferences, but you can also start VS Code from Windows and reconnect to WSL. Click on the lower left of your Code window and select WSL and you are back in as if you were always here.

# AppArmor

WSL is meant to look and feel like a terminal only version of real Ubuntu and for the most part it offers you just that. The one place where the illusion breaks is with apparmor. Normally you don't care until an installer breaks because apparmor really isn't there. This applies to most packages which work over the network. One example of a tool that breaks in installation is the Postgres admin tool, pgadmin-desktop.

It's worth just getting this out of the way once so you never have to deal with it again. It is not required for RStudio.

## Configure systemd

``` bash
$ sudo gedit /etc/wsl.conf
```

Add the following two lines:

``` text
[boot] 
systemd=true
```

Note that this may make the following warning appear each time you start WSL. It is safe to ignore:

``` text
wsl: Failed to start the systemd user session for 'yourname'. See journalctl for more details.
```

## Edit fstab

Add the following line to the end of /etc/fstab:

``` text
securityfs /sys/kernel/security securityfs defaults 0 0
```

## Restart

``` text
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> wsl --shutdown
```

Start your WSL normally.

## Enable AppArmor

``` bash
$ sudo systemctl enable --now apparmor
```

Reboot WSL once more and try an experiment:

``` bash
$ sudo apt install pgadmin-desktop
```

If this installs without throwing an error you are good to go.

# R

## Install R itself:

``` bash
$ sudo apt install build-essential gfortran
$ sudo apt install r-base
$ sudo apt install libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype6-dev
```

## Install R Packages from Binaries

Before installing user libraries set up your .Rprofile to use the Posit repo. The main reason is this repo has pre-compiled R packages so is much faster than CRAN. Duckdb for instance can take an hour or more to install from CRAN. [For more information about using the Posit binary repos go here](https://packagemanager.posit.co/client/#/repos/cran/setup).

If on WSL, find your Ubuntu codename:

``` text
$ lsb_release -a

No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS
Release:        24.04
Codename:       noble
```

For WSL: `$ gedit ~/.Rprofile` . For R on Windows: `notepad $env:USERPROFILE\.Rprofile`

Add these lines to .Rprofile.

``` r
# For R on Windows: 
# options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/latest"))


# For R on Ubuntu/WSL, replace "noble" with the correct codename: 
options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/__linux__/noble/latest"))



# Set Cairo as default bitmap device
# This is only needed for OSX, but here just in case plots don't render.
# options(bitmapType = "cairo")
```

## Install RStudio:

For R I find RStudio much more comfortable to use than VS Code. We'll go over the installation and configuration here. Go to [Posit's download page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and scroll down to find the right deb package (from lsb_release, above), and paste the link to it below:

``` bash
$ mkdir ~/downloads
$ cd ~/downloads

$ wget https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/jammy/amd64/rstudio-2025.09.2-418-amd64.deb

$ sudo apt install ./rstudio-2025.09.2-418-amd64.deb

# If needed: 
# mkdir ~/bin
$ gedit ~/bin/rstudio
```

Add these lines to \~/bin/rstudio to make it more terminal friendly:

``` text
#! /usr/bin/bash

/usr/bin/rstudio  > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

Make it executable

``` bash
$ chmod +x ~/bin/rstudio
```

At this point you can start RStudio from the command line or Windows application menu. Start RStudio and check that you have the Posit repo installed:

``` r
getOption("repos")
```

Should return a string with "posit".

**Protip:** if you have significant trouble installing R packages from Posit or CRAN try installing the Ubuntu package first, and then re-installing your user library version. This will help because the repo builders do an excellent job of installing all the OS package dependencies. You can then install the package to your local library. For instance:

``` bash
$ sudo apt install r-cran-tidyverse
```

Then in RStudio:

``` r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

This way you'll get the latest version from CRAN or Posit.

## R Libraries

If you work among others who are forced to do R in Windows I strongly suggest you leverage the here package/function. It is like `this.path` but with automatic path separators based on the OS you are using.

here() returns the path relative to the project, so it allows for portability not just among Windows/Linux but also from R scripts and Rmd/Qmd docs and Shiny apps.

``` r
library(here)
my_data_file <- here('data', 'my_datastore.rds')
my_data_file

[1] "/home/yourname/dev/RStudio_with_Windows/data/my_datastore.rds"
```

When running from Rscript though you need to start in the project root. Here's an example:

``` bash
$ cd ~/dev/finance_forecast_project
$ Rscript R/my_forecast.R
```

# Homebrew

Homebrew is a great tool for OSX developers. I'm pretty sure every single development tool and package out there has a recipe or cask for OSX. It's being developed for Linux as well but support is pretty spotty and honestly just IMHO not necessary. 'apt install' works just fine.

# Perl

If you are going to do Perl development you should install [perlbrew](https://perlbrew.pl/). This gives you a personal Perl installation you can pick and chose the effective Perl version. Install the padwalker package from CPAN and you should be able to debug in VS Code like you would any other remote Perl installation.
